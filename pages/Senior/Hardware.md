## What is a Computer
A computer is a machine made from smaller parts, which all work together, completing instructions given from machine code. Each part has its own "job", which is ultimately controlled by the machine's processor, also known as the CPU. Every part is connected too, and pass data through, the motherboard. The motherboard is the foundation of a computer. 

- ### R.A.M
  - RAM stands for Radom Access Memory and is referred to as ram or memory. Ram stores temporary data (infomation) that may be needed very soon, very quickly. Ram has a small total capacity relitive to other storage devices, but is exceptionly fast. Computers have a *speed* to them (its more coplicated than that but *speed* works for now) and the faster the better. The normal type of ram, DRAM, can run at a rate of 2-20GB per seconds (GB -- Giga-bite -- being a measurment of the amount of data) where you can expect an average storage device (disk hard drive) to run at 0.2Gb/s. However, a disktriver can store thousands of GBs while the average *stick* of ram is only 8GB, and an average computer holds in total, 8 - 16gbs of RAM.
