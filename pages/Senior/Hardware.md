## What is a Computer
A computer is a machine made from smaller parts, which all work together, completing instructions given from machine code. Each part has its own "job", which is ultimately controlled by the machine's processor, also known as the CPU. Every part is connected too, and pass data through, the motherboard. The motherboard is the foundation of a computer. 

- ### R.A.M
  - RAM stands for Radom Access Memory and is referred to as ram or memory. Ram stores temporary data (infomation) that may be needed very soon, very quickly. It;s called volatile storage, since it loses any data stored when power is lost. Ram has a small total capacity relitive to other storage devices, but is exceptionly fast. Computers have a *speed* to them (its more coplicated than that but *speed* works for now) and the faster the better. The normal type of ram, DRAM, can run at a rate of 2-20GB per seconds (GB -- Giga-bite -- being a measurment of the amount of data) where you can expect an average storage device (disk hard drive) to run at 0.2Gb/s. However, a disktriver can store thousands of GBs while the average *stick* of ram is only 8GB, and an average computer holds in total, 8 - 16gbs of RAM.

- ### Storage
  - Storage is almost like the opposite of RAM. It's non-volatile, a way to store data permanently, even when the power is lost. Its ability to read and write data is a lot slower relative to volatile storage, but the trade-off is a much larger total capacity. The most common type of storage is disk storage (HDD). Disk storage uses a disk called a **platter** to store infomation in binary form. A faster alternative is called Solid-state drives and are becomming much more poopular. SSD's use no mechanical parts and insted semiconductors. As a consequence they're faster and more physically shock-resistant then HDDs. However, SSDs have a shorter life time and are more expersive then HDDs currently. 
- ### CPU
  - The Central Processing Unit, also known as the processor, is the central part of the computer which utilizes the different parts of the computer to execute instructions and allocate resources. It runs according to instructions and performs arithmetic, logic, handles some inputs and outputs operations.
- ### Motherboard
  - The motherboard is an expandable printed circuit board to which all other parts are connected. It usually comes with inputs, such as USB, multiple slots for ram, graphics card, fans, other cooling support and a slot for the cpu. The motherboard has printed wires called a *bus*. The bus acts as the communication highway for the computer, allowing the componenct to communicate and pass infomation to each other. Motherboard buses have a property called bandwidth, which is the amount of data a bus can carry at once. 

### Binary
Computers run on bits. Bits are the fundamental state which is used to store data. A bit is either a 1 or a 0. When combined, this type of data (base 2/binary), can be used to represent any sort of information. Lots of bits make up binary infomation. Computers understand machine code. Machine code is simply binary codes that work on the cpu.
